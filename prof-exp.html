      <p class = "paragraph">
        In the summer of 2025, I interned at LOVECHROME USA, a luxury comb company
        as an IT intern. I led several projects to transition the company
        from Amazon-based fulfillment to self-fulfillment. This included developing
        a custom inventory tracking system that automatically deducted stock upon order 
        receipt and triggered personalized confirmation emails to customers. I also 
        integrated Shopify with accounting software to streamline tax and profit reporting. 
        I also implemented a barcode-based system that allowed us to scan shipping labels 
        and verify products before packagingâ€”dramatically reducing fulfillment errors. 
        As a result of these efforts, customer complaints dropped from around five per 
        month to just one in three months. Overall it was a great learning experience 
        and I had a great time at LOVECHROME.
